# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# OpenLayers ReactJS Project

## Overview

This project is a web application built with ReactJS and OpenLayers, aimed at providing an interactive map experience with features like dark and light modes, geocoding-based location search, and weather information popups. The application leverages React Context API, `useRef`, and `useState` hooks for state management and component interaction.

## Features

- **Dark and Light Modes:** Toggle between dark and light themes for the map to enhance user experience.
- **Geocoding Search:** Search for locations using geocoding services and display a popup with weather information for the searched location.
- **Interactive Map Click:** Click on the map to retrieve weather data for the clicked location.
- **Clustered Markers:** View clustered markers on the map, with popups emerging based on clustering characteristics.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **OpenLayers:** JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers.
- **Context API:** Manage global state in React applications.
- **useRef and useState:** React hooks for managing state and references within components.
- **Geocoding API:** Service to convert addresses into geographic coordinates.
- **Weather API:** Service to fetch weather data for specific locations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openlayers-react-project.git
   cd openlayers-react-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Toggle Dark/Light Mode:**

   - Use the provided button to switch between dark and light map themes.

2. **Search for a Location:**

   - Enter a location in the search bar.
   - The map will center on the searched location, and a popup with weather information will appear.

3. **Click on the Map:**

   - Click any location on the map.
   - A popup will display the weather data for the clicked location.

4. **View Clustered Markers:**
   - Zoom in and out of the map to see markers clustered together.
   - Click on a cluster to view individual markers and their information.

## Code Highlights

### Context API for Theme Management

The `ThemeContext` is used to manage the dark and light mode states across the application.

### Map Component with OpenLayers

The `MapComponent` uses `useRef` to interact with the OpenLayers map instance.
